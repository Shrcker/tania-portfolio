            <h1>Hey Howdy, I'm Tania Shirkey</h1>
            <p>I'm a programmer currently enrolled at OSU to learn Fullstack Development. I'm mostly interested in interactive design, especially in regards to game's programming and UI/UX functionality. This site represents a directory of work I've thusfar completed, and feel free to contact me from here using the link at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>

                    <p>Have built and deployed a fully functioning, if rudimentary, study guide for my classes. Contains rudimentary interactivity within its console, which was made using JavaScript, that suggests to the user what topic they should study.</p>
